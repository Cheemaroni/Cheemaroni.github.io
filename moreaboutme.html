        <h3><u>Chapter 1: Early Gaming Experiences</u></h3>
        <p>
          I have been playing video games since I was old enough to really grasp putting on a game and turning it on. Whether it be from my older sister's computer, my DS, or sneaking into my older brother's room and playing on his PS3, I tried anyway to find a game and play it. I don't know exactly what my first game was, but I have very vivid memories of playing "Disney Princess Magical Jewels" for the DS, which is an AWFUL game playing now, but I do remember having a bit of fun playing it when I was younger.

        <h3><u>Chapter 2: Exploring Different Game Types</u></h3>
        <p>
          When I began to get older and my brain could comprehend more than collecting jewels, I started to play more adventure-type puzzle solvers and had some silly games on the side. I began to play games such as "Super Mario DS," "SpongeBob's Atlantis SquarePants" (which is actually the first game I ever remember finishing), "New Super Mario Bros," "Mario & Luigi - Bowser's Inside Story," etc., with exceptions of "Cooking Mama" and "Hannah Montana Music Jam."

  <h3><u>Chapter 3: The Introduction of GameCube</u></h3>
  <p>
    I was gifted a GameCube early in my life, and I still don't know who it belonged to; it could've been my uncle's or a shared console among my siblings. Regardless, it opened a whole new world of video games that I could play in my room without worrying about my brother telling me to go away, as you know how teenagers can be. Games included with my new gift were "Pokémon Colosseum," "SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom," "Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes," "The Adventure of Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius: Jet Fusion," "Star Wars Bounty Hunter," "Resident Evil Zero," "Resident Evil," "Luigi's Mansion," and "Metroid Prime." In that order, these were my favorites, with the first four being my most obsessed-over.

        <h3><u>Chapter 4: Deepening Interest in Gaming</u></h3>
        <p>
          My progression through games began to get more serious, and I started to favor more action RPGs, puzzles, and horror games. This journey was further fueled by playing on my GameCube and experiencing titles like "Castle Crashers," "Uncharted," and "GTA IV" on my brother's PS3. I was hooked.

        <h3><u>Chapter 5: The Arrival of the WiiU</u></h3>
        <p>
          It wasn't until December 24, 2012, that the new release of Nintendo's Wii U came along, and little Gab got her own. It was an amazing day, and I was unbelievably happy to have my BRAND NEW CONSOLE WITH THE LATEST GAMES, marking a new chapter in my gaming journey. I received games like "Lego City Undercover," "Scribblenauts Unlimited," "The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker," "NintendoLand" (which I regularly played), "Super Mario 3D World," and "New Super Mario Bros. U," in that order of preference. During this period, my gaming addiction escalated, especially during summer breaks.

        <h3><u>Chapter 6: The Gaming Addiction Escalation</u></h3>
        <p>
          I was constantly playing my games until SEVEN AM and sleeping in until three or four PM. I was also gifted an iPad, and with all of these games and being the youngest, I was left to my own devices. Day after day, it would be me playing all these games, and then finally, my family had enough, and oop, there goes my electronics (I also broke my iPad and Wii U pad). I wasn't allowed to have them for quite a while.

        <h3><u>Chapter 7: The Computer Era</u></h3>
        <p>
          In fifth grade, my sister "upgraded" from her old Windows 64 desktop and got a Chromebook laptop. I was now handed down her amazing computer and began another game obsession, this time with "The Sims 2." When I tell you I get intensely absorbed in games, I REALLY DO. It was a repeat of what had happened with my Wii U and iPad, and, well, history repeats, and my computer was then gone with the rest.

        <h3><u>Chapter 8: A Break From Gaming</u></h3>
        <p>
          I occasionally would play on my Nintendo 3DS, which I received sometime in December 2011. I was eventually given back my GameCube and iPad, but my gaming wasn't as serious. I ended up being a really moody preteen with high depression and wasn't really interested in gaming for maybe a year and a half.

        <h3><u>Chapter 9: Rediscovering Gaming through Steam</u></h3>
        <p>
          Until I got the courage to ask my brother if I could play some of his games on his Steam account when he's out with friends, and he said yes! I wouldn't play any serious games and more of CSGO (with bots), Portal, PayDay 2, and that was about it.

        <h3><u>Chapter 10: A New Beginning with Steam</u></h3>
        <p>
          Skip forward to two years in August 2017, my brother gave me his old desktop, and I set up a Steam account, but I didn't have money, so it was just their free games. In November 23, 2018, my brother gave me some money to buy games on Steam, marking a NEW CHAPTER. I then proceeded to buy "Fallout 4," "Grand Theft Auto V," "The Sims 3," and "The Stanley Parable."

        <h3><u>Chapter 11: Discovering Fallout 4</u></h3>
        <p>
          I found out about Fallout 4 from my cousin during one visit to my aunt's house. He had visited from college and brought his PS4, so, being me, I asked if I could play, and my god, I loved it. Now having it for my own, I was introduced to the amazing Company Bethesda and their Fallout and Elder Scrolls series.

        <h3><u>Chapter 12: Gaming and Friendships</u></h3>
        <p>
          Like I usually do, I was constantly playing my new games, but with some limits, as I also had a friend group at the time and wanted to spend as much time with them as possible. But eventually, things changed, and we dismantled, and I began playing much more.

        <h3><u>Chapter 13: Expanding the Game Collection</u></h3>

          In 2019, I got "Limbo," "Garry's Mod," "Left 4 Dead 2," "Lucius," "Goat Simulator," "The Forest," "Phasmophobia," and it carried on until the present day, with me playing well-known games.

        <h3><u>Chapter 14: Embracing RPGs and Emulation</u></h3>
        <p>
          From this point in time, I was very obsessed with playing my RPGs and have grown to like them a lot. I ended up beating "Fallout 4," "Skyrim," "GTA V," and "Lucius" and then started finding games similar to them and began emulating. I started to emulate games for PS2 and played "Bully," "GTA San Andreas," and it carried on until the present day, with getting more games on Steam and my emulators.
