            <h2>Hobby(gaming)</h2>
            <p>
              I have been playing video games since I was old enough to really grasp putting on a game and turning it on. Whether it be from my older sisters computer, my ds, or sneaking into my older brothers room and playing on his ps3, I tried anyway to find a game and play it. I don't know exactly what my first game was but I have very vivid memories of playing "Disney Princess Magical Jewels" for the DS which is an AWFUL game playing now but I do remember having a bit of fun playing it when I was younger.  When I began to get older and my brain could comprehend more than collecting jewels, I started to play more adventure type puzzle solvers and my silly game son the side. I began to play games such as "Super Mario DS", "SpongeBob's Atlantis SquarePants" which is actually the first game I ever remember finishing, "New Super Mario Bros", Mario & Luigi - Bowser's Inside Story", etc. with exceptions of "Cooking Mama" and "Hannah Montana Music Jam". I was gifted some time early in my life a GameCube that I still don't know who it belonged to could've been my uncle or my siblings older shared console I don't know, anyways it opened a whole other world of video games that I could play in my room without worrying about my brother telling me to fuck off cause you know how teenagers can be. Games included with my new gift were "Pokémon Colosseum", "SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom", "Metal Gear Solid The Twin Snakes", "The Adventure of Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius Jet Fusion",  "Star Wars Bounty Hunter", "Resident Evil Zero", "Resident Evil", "Luigi's Mansion", and "Metroid Prime". In that order was my favorited to kind of least, I was mostly obsessed with the first four listed. My progression through games began to get more serious and I started to favor more action RPG puzzles or horrors and through playing on my GameCube and "Castle Crashers", "Uncharted" and "GTA IV" on my brothers PS3 I was hooked. It wasn't until December 24, 2012 came along and the new release of Nintendo's WiiU had just released that year that little Gab got her own. It was such an amazing day and I was so unbelievably happy that I had my BRAND NEW CONSOLE WITH THE LATEST GAMES and began a new chapter of gaming. I was gifted games like "Lego City Undercover", "Scribblenauts Unlimited", "The Legend of Zelda the WindWaker", "NintendoLand(yes I regularly played that), "Super Mario 3D World", and "New Super Mario Bros.U". Again favorite to least order. Its this time of my life that I would progressively get worst with my gaming addiction especially on summer break. I was constantly playing my games till SEVEN AM and sleeping in till three or four pm. I was also gifted an iPad and with all of these games and being the youngest I was left to my own devices. Day after day it would be me playing all these games and then finally my family had enough and oop there goes my electronics (I also broke my iPad and WiiU pad). I weren't allowed them for quite awhile honestly and in fifth grade my sister "upgraded" from her old Windows 64 desktop and got a chrome book laptop. I was now handed down her amazing computer and began another game obsession. The Sims 2. My god when I tell you I get into games so intensely I REALLY DO. It was a repeat of what had happened with my WiiU and iPad and well history repeats and my computer was then gone with the rest. I occasionally would play on my Nintendo 3DS that was gifted some time in December 2011 and I was eventually given back my GameCube and iPad but my gaming wasn't as serious and just ended up me being a really moody preteen with high depression not really interested for maybe a year and a half until I got the courage to ask my brother if I could play some of his games on his Steam account when he's out with friends  and he said yes! I wouldn't play any serious games and more of CSGO (with bots), Portal, PayDay 2, and that was about it. Skip forward to two years in August 2017 my brother gave me his old desktop and I set up a steam account but I didn't have money so it was just their free games. In November 23, 2018 my brother gave me some money to buy games on steam NEW CHAPTERR. I then proceeded to buy "Fallout 4", "Grand Theft Auto V", "The Sims 3", and "The Stanely Parable". I found out about Fallout 4 from my cousin one visit to my aunts house. He had visited from college and brought his PS4 so me being me I asked if I could play and my god I loved it. Now having it for my own I was introduced to the amazing Company Bethesda and their Fallout and Elder Scrolls games which I had borrowed from my brothers account in Steam. Like I usually do I was constantly playing my new games but with some limits cause I also had a friend group at the time and wanted to spend as much time with them as possible. But eventually shit happens and we dismantled and I began playing much more. In 2019 I got "Limbo", "Garry's Mod", "Left 4 Dead 2", "Lucius", "Goat Simulator", "The Forest", "Phasmophobia", and it carried on till present day with me playing known games (I'll create a new page with list of those games and consoles I had and it'll go from there). From this point in time I was very obsessed with playing my RPGS and have grown to liked them a lot. I ended up beating "Fallout 4", "Skyrim", "GTA V", and "Lucius" and then started finding games similar to them and began emulating. I started to emulate games for ps2 and played "Bully", "GTA San Andres", and it carried up until present day with getting more games on steam and my emulators. I'm still playing more games and will continue to for as long as I can and will fill you guys in on my progress for such games and ones I've completed with my reviews.
