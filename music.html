 11/5/23 - I just want to say that this took me a ridiculously long time like, my god the time it took to work on this Webamp code caused me so much pain and frustration especially since my limited knowledge in coding didn't help the situation. However, it was all worth it because now I can share the music I enjoy and the songs I'm currently listening to while also creating reading material for people to enjoy.  That's the purpose of this page, by the way.  a space to discover unfamiliar music, something out of some peoples comfort zone and to read about my thoughts, foods I enjoy, games, and animals I love. I hope you will get a lot out of this page whether it be new ideas of food recipes, video games to play, or some new music to add in your playlists. Thank you and I hope you enjoy. XX

    11/8/23 7:47AM - I just realized you aren't handed a receipt after youget ice cream from a parlor.<br>
    8:20 AM - Sometimes I forget that I am the only me in the world. There is small chance right now in my life to find someone smiliar to me and it kinda makes me sad to think about it. I Yes, I've found people with similar interests, music taste, humor, and one part of my personality but somehow it ends up not feeling right and the relationship never reaches a place I'd want it to which sucks but it happens. Finding people is hard. Socializing is hard. I'm slowly losing my social skills and going to a school where all the people are similar to their personalities just makes me feel like an odd one out.<br>
    8:45 AM - MY BIKE SUCKSS! It doesn't have that plastic protective piece over the crankset so whenever I pedal and I happen to wear loose fitting pants THE FUCKING PANT LEG GET CAUGHT IN THIS LITTLE METAL THING THAT STICK OUT AND RIPPPSS OFF A A HUGE PIECE OF FABRIC. I have about three pairs of pants that I can't wear anymore because of my bike ripping it up, so now whenever I bike I have to tuck in my pant leg into my sock or roll them up completely past the knee which IS UNNNCOMFORTABLEEEE. My bike sucks.<br>

        <h2>Tallarines Verdes w/carne</h2><br>
        <img src='Tallarin Verde.jpg' style="float:left; border: 1px solid black;" height="180px">
        This is a childhood favorite of mine, my mother would cook this Peruvian dish with Cuban skirt steak and recently I've been craving it like crazy. I want to share this one since its such a perfect simple meal to make (just takes some time).<BR>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Ingredients for pasta</h3>
        1 pound spaghetti<br>
        2 tablespoons chopped shallots<br>
        3 garkuc ckives, chopped<br>
        2/3 cup toasted and roughly chopped walnuts<br>
        3 cups baby spinach<br>
        4 ounces cotija cheese slightly crumbled, plus more for garnish<br>
        3/4 evaporated milk<br>
        3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil<br>
        3/4 teaspoon salt<br>
        1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper<br>
        <h3>Ingredients for sour orange mojo</h3>
        6 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped<br>
        1 Scotch bonnet chile, stemmed, seeded and minced<br>
        1 to 2 teaspoons cumin seeds, toasted<br>
        1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br>
        1/3 cup equal parts lime and orange juice or 1/3 cup sour orange juice<br>
        1 cup olive oil<br>
        2 teaspoons sherry vinegar<br>
        and some Freshly ground black pepper to taste<br>
        <h3>Ingredients for skirt steak</h3>
        1 1/2 pounds skirt steak, trimmed<br>
        1 cup red onion, finely minced<br>
        1 tablespoon flat leaf parsley, minced<br>
        Avocado Oil<br>
        2 teaspoons unsalted butter<br>
        1 lime, quartered<br>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        1. Start by cooking your pasta al dente around 7 to 9 minutes making sure to stirr ocassionally. When ready drain and toss in a little olive oil and set aside.<br>
        2. Begin by putting your chopped shallots, garlic, and walnuts into a food processor and pule until coarse crumbs are made. Add the spinach, basil, and cheese then contune to pulse.<br>
        3. With the processor running on low add the evaporated milk and oil. Seaon to your liking with salt and pepper and puree until smooth.<br>
        4. Pour the mixture into a large bowl and mix in your sphagetti and adjust the seaoning to your liking. Leave to the side and begin preping the steak.<br>
        <br>
        1. Begin by placing olive oil into a small saucepan and place it over medium-low heat. Make sure while its warming up you do not let it get too hot, after a little place the salt, garlic, cumin, and Scotch bonnet into a mortar and beat them up a bit wtih the pestle if on hand.<br>
        2. Add the warm oil to the mortar and let the seasonings steep for 10 minutes or longer. Begin whisking in the juices and vinegar and season with pepper for taste.<br>
        3. Season the skirt steak with salt (or adobe like I would do) the same time you start to make the mojo. I recommend if you can to let the mojo meld overnight, (which reallly makes the steak super juicy and falvourful).<br>
        4. Give the mojo sauce a good shake or stir. Pour plenty of it over the skirt steak, making sure you get lots of peppers, garlic, and zesty juice in there. Let the steak soak up the flavors but don't leave it in the marinade for more than an hour. If you do, the marinade might overwhelm the taste of the beef, and the whole idea is to keep it nice.<br>
        5. While the steak is marinating, heat a pan over high heat and add a coat of oil around the pan and then add some red onions if you'd like. Moon cut is fine. Let them sear a bit but not become soft and translucent.Then remove and add in separate bowl.<br>
        6. Begin heating a large pan for the steak and have it set ober medium high heat. Cover the pan in oil and begin to let it get hot.<br>
        7. Drain the steaks of the marinade and pick off any stuck on garlic and pepper.<br>
        8. Add the butter to the pan and let the oil and butter merge into each other then begin to lay the steaks onto the pan/ Sear both sides of the steakas and cook until nice and caramelized.<br>
        9. After the steak is cooked to your liking you can take it out and place it on a plate and add some of the pans juice to it if you'd like.<br>
        10. Begin plating your sphagetti and if you'd like add a bit of the cheese on the top and then cut or just straight up add your steak to the plate.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Thats it! Now time to enjoy your amazinnngg meal mm mm mm

        <h2>Ceviche</h2><br>
        <img src='Ceviche.jpg' style="float:right; border: 1px solid black;" height="180px">
        If you're a fish lover you might love this dish. Another food from my childhood is Peruvian Ceviche, you can make it spicy or not depending if you'd like to add the Habanero pepper but I like both. The cooking for this is all from the acids forming a pH conditions to denature the fish protein networks, just like how heating would.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        2 tsp Cilantro<br>
        6 Garlic Cloves<br>
        2-3 sprigs of fresh cilantro<br>
        1 Habenero Pepper cut in half, deseed(optional)<br>
        8 Limes<br>
        1 Red Onion<br>
        Salt and Pepper<br>
        2 lbs Tilapia filets or or other firm white fish fillets, cubed<br>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        1. Cut your fish into cubed pieces and place them into a bowl of cold water with a tablespoon of salt and refrigerate while preparing the onions and jucing the limes.<br> 
        2. Juice all limes and set them aside in a bowl and then cut thin the red onion in a moon shape and rinse the onions in cold water with 1/2 tablespoon of salt.<br>
        3. Now rinse the fish to remove all the salt and place the fish in a glass bowl with the onions, cilantro, and hot peppers (optional) and begin to pour the lime juice all over the ingredients. Spinkle just a bit of salt while mixing all the ingredients together and if you'd like, add some ice cubes to minimize the acidity.<br>
        4. Cover it and refrigerate for aroun 10 to fifteen minutes.
        5. Remove the hotpeppers and then taste the ceviche and add any additional seasonings if needed.
        <br>
        <br>
        Boom! You're done! You can even add fresh boiled corn or sweet potatoes to the ceviche and it adds more great flavor and textures to the dish. I hop eyou try this one out since its SOO GOOOOD!!

    <h2>Jimmy Neutron and Children Games</h2><br>
    <img src='Jimmy Neutron Jet Fusion.png' style="float:right; border: 1px solid black;" height="180px">
    Okay I don’t know if it’s just me but does anyone else feel that children GameCube games for cartoons are incredibly long? Since the games are meant to challenge the young minds they are most often puzzle based. The thing is I realized that they can be so incredibly lonnngggg, I feel like they eventually lose their plot about five hours into gameplay since after awhile it goes back to endless puzzle solving. I must be the worst gamer especially at a young age cause I searched up the average game time FOR The Adventure of Jimmy Neutron JetFusion to complete the main missions and its totaled to FIVE HOURS and TWENTY-SEVEN MINUTES. IM SORRY? HOW? I remember little Gab playing that game for about five hours and being in a new area feeling no where near the finish line. I began to just play the games beginning until I would stop at a certain point of exhaustion and bored cause the scenario just lost it’s appeal and so did it’s gameplay. I remember being so sick of the puzzle concept over and over again that when I passed this jungle area and went into a Japanese area I just gave up and whenever I wanted to play the game I would create an entirely new save file just to relive the parts I was happy with, up to the point where I got pretty damn good on secret stashes and the maps layout. I do like all of the intricate details  incorporated in the maps puzzles, they do add a certain pleasure and overall good feeling to the environment, it just doesn’t feel like same after awhile of doing SOO MANNNYY PUZZLESSSSS!!! I seriously forget what the whole purpose of all the crap I’m doing and then when I’m remember I’m like “Fuckkk thiisisss.” I seriously just have to STOP at a certain point and do something else. I really do like the feeling when I play the game since it’s a childhood favorite but I seriously don’t know if I’ll ever be able to finish it. I find it interesting though to see this continuous pattern in children games, it makes sense for all of them to be in similar layout but its INCREDIBLE that for ten years I haven’t beaten any of those games. The games being SpongeBob SquarePants Creature from the KrustyKrab (CRTKK) and Battle for Bikini Bottom (BFBB). It’s polled doe the gameplay for CFTKK to have an average of four hours and thirty six minutes and BFBB to have ten hours which honestly makes more since I remember getting to this area where there were MULTIPLE DOORS AND YOU HAD TO OPEN ALL OFF THEMMMM. It was a terrible feeling. I’m honestly more shocked over CFTKK since like the other games I repeatedly played it till a certain point so it felt longer than it should be but even then I played that game for nearly six hours and I got as far as Planktons dream of being chased by a Krabby Patty. It just got so borinnggg man like okay Spongebobs dream was cool and nice but Patricks was WAYY more better and then after that it being Planktons mid ass parkour dream was just such a turn off. I lovED the superhero comic feel for Patricks dream, it just seemed so fitting and engaging with all the colors, comic strip style, and nice chill music in the back. I don’t really know the storyline for that game either like I think its just a game of their dreams and stuff which is a cool idea it just got boring. It’s funny though cause I don’t even think I’ve finished another GameCube games I’ve owned and I sorta just did the same thing where I would play to a certain part and then new save and restart, games like StarWars : Bounty Hunter, Luigis Mansion, Metroid Prime, and Metal Gear Solid The Twin Snakes. Now talking about all these games I really want to play them soooooo badly and try to get them done. Hopefully later in life I will eventually finish them and close an important chapter of my childhood. I’d also like to say that I applaud the companies who make the children games challenging and full of puzzles, I hink it’s a great idea way better than finding them mindless bullshit they constantly play. I think the only reason I didn’t really finish or work through all of them was cause it eventually lost it’s appeal. I no longer cared towards the goal I was working for and everything was so fucking dull. I wasn’t excited anymore of completing puzzles or finding new areas and the continuous puzzle without going back to the story made it worse for me to get into. I wish I had more patience as a child with them and pushed through but I hope now that I’m an adult I can get them done.
