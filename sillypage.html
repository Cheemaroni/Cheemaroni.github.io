    <div class="horizontal-box">
        <p style="color: maroon;">I know it's been such a long time since we last spoke, and I've been unable to face the truth or even 'see' you since the day I witnessed you being lowered into the cold, unforgiving earth. I'm haunted by the relentless thoughts of what happened. That perhaps, if I hadn't buried myself in work, if I hadn't constantly distanced myself or tried to find fault in our relationship through you, then I could have been there for you...</p>
        <p style="color: maroon;">Why. Why did you have to go. I know before we hadn't been talking as much, or well I haven't been. But why. You ruined me. I feel numb for most of the time that I'm conscious. Our bedroom is a torment, a place I can't set foot in without crumbling to pieces...</p>
