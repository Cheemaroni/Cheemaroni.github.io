      <div class="horizontal-box">
        <p>I know it's been such an long time since we last spoke, and I've been unable to face the truth or even 'see' you. The day I witnessed you being lowered into the cold, unforgiving earth. I'm haunted by the relentless thoughts of what happened. That perhaps, if I hadn't buried myself in work, I could have been there for you. The thunder terrifies me. I used to scoff at others who cowered at the sound of thunder, but now I comprehend their terror all too well. Days like today, when thunderstorms increase and rage for what seems hours, force me into a state of disconnection. I find myself huddled in the darkest corner of our once-shared bedroom, left alone with my memories. The tears flow uncontrollably as I realize how I failed you, how I let distance creep between us, how I allowed myself to arrive home at the oddest hours of the night. If only I had left the office sooner, I might have been there to shield you from the impending darkness that took you away from me. The guilt is starting to become too much I fear that maybe that darkness would consume me too.</p>
