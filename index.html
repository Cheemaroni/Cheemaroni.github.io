                Hello there! I'm Gab, and I'm excited to introduce you to my new website, a dedicated space where I share my passions, hobbies, and my journey in progression with them, complete with reviews. This platform also serves as an opportunity for me to dive deeper into HTML coding and also to just be silly goofy with creating things. I'd also like to connect my Twitch and YouTube accounts, potentially expanding my follower base. If you decide to explore my page, I hope you find some of my content enjoyable! ☆⌒(≧▽​° )
